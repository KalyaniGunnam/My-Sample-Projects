                        On your birthday, I want you to know how much you mean to me. You are my sunshine, and your smile brightens up even the darkest of days. You have brought so much love and joy into my life, and I am grateful to have you as my son.
                        As you celebrate another year of life, I hope you know how proud I am of the person you are becoming. You are intelligent, kind, and so much more, and I am excited to watch you grow and succeed.
